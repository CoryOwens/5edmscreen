# 5edmscreen

## Objective

Forked from [ceryliae's 5edmscreen](https://github.com/ceryliae/5edmscreen), but adapting it to use Markdown for better code readability and modification. Index entries will be linked to their respective entries on [D&D Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com). Indices will be added for additional sources. Unfortunately, additional content on the screen may be limited by copyright concerns, so the screen will still only use SRD content.
